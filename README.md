# RandomLaser / Fluorescence Simulations using COMSOL-Multiphysics (+ OriginLab, Python and MATLAB for data analysis / replication)

In this work I present a 3D model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) to study the fluorescence phenomena through the numerical solution of Helmholtz Equations for the excitation light propagation and emission fluence rate using COMSOL Multiphysics platform. 

The problem is divided in two steps: the excitation of an arbitrary fluorescent material by the absorption of the energy from incident photons and the spontaneous emission of the material when it is returning to the ground state.
For our first tests we chose to use Rhodamine 6G, a fluroescent dye derivative of xanthene. Its fluorescence has been vastly studied and I personally characterized its optical properties experimentally, making us able to compare our theoretical results to our real experiments.
