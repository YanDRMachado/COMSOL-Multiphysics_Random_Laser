# RandomLaser_COMSOL-Multiphysics
Random Laser simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics.

In this work we present a 3D model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) to study the fluorescence of Rhodamine 6G through the numerical solution of Helmholtz Equations for the light propagation and diffusion problems using the COMSOL Multiphysics platform. The problem is divided in two steps: The excitation of Rhodamine 6G will by the absorption energy of the incident photons, and the spontaneous emission of the dye when it is returning to the ground state.
